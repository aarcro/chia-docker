# Mass miner

Go build: https://github.com/massnetorg/MassNet-miner.git
And copy the /bin/\* here

If you don't want to use UID 1000, update some stuff


This is all untested. DONT expose 9685 9686, to the internet, those are the ports for cli to talk to the miner.
(You wouldn't put your chia daemon on the internet)
